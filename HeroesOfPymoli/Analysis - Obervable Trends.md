## 3 Observable Trends



1. Final Critic is the most popular item, as well as the most profitable item for the company. 
2. Item Price doesn't seem to dictate popularity - Higher priced items, continue to be popular. Maybe an opportunity to price an item even higher for additional profits. I.E. Persuasion is a popular item, however, its not a profitable item - we should increase the price to create additional profit on the item.
3. Ages 25-29 seem to be the age bracket that purchases the most product. However, Ages 35-39 seem to spend on average, more money per item. We should market to this group to increase purchase count!
